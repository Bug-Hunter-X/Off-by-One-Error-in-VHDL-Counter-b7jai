This repository contains a VHDL example demonstrating a common off-by-one error in a simple counter.  The `buggy_counter.vhd` file shows the erroneous code, while `fixed_counter.vhd` provides the corrected version. The bug is subtle, highlighting the importance of careful checking of boundary conditions in hardware description languages.  The bug arises from a potential typo or misunderstanding when handling the counter's maximum value.
